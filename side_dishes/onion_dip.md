# Ingredients

- 4 large onions, default is yellow but works with red as well
- 1/4 tsp + 1 pinch baking soda
- 1 tbs salt (see notes)
- 1 tbs brown sugar
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- vinegar
- water, or white wine (opt)
- salt and pepper
- 1 1/2 cup sour cream (full fat)
- 3/4 cup mayo
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder (see notes)

# Preparation

- Slice the onion thin
- Put the onion in a pot with the baking soda, salt and sugar.
- Mix to combine and break the onion appart.
- Cover and let rest for 10 min, until onions start to sweat and break appart.
- Put over high heat and mix in the olive oil.
- Stirring often, cook the onion until reduced to 25% of original volume and has a golden color.
- Reduce the heat to medium.
- Keep stirring until it start to brown and stick to the pot.
- Deglaze with some water (or wine) and the vinegar.
- Keep stirring until it has thickened and is now dark brown.
- Remove from heat and let cool.
- Combine in a bowl with the rest of the ingredients.
- Let cool in the refrigerator.

# Notes:

- This recipe is from Alton Brown:

- From experience, 1 tbs salt is a bit much, depending on the vinegar used.
  I've used balsamic so I would put like 2 tsp of salt next time and salt after
  if needed.
- I've tried deglazing with wine instead of water and it's pretty good.
- Don't put more garlic powder than recommended. The flavour will become more potent
  the longer the dip rests and it will otherwise overpower the other flavours.
